      <p className="my-4 leading-7">
        Hello! I&apos;m Lucas Veras, a sports scientist nearing the completion
        of my PhD in Physical Activity and Health at the Faculty of Sport,
        University of Porto. My academic journey began with a Bachelor&apos;s
        degree in Physical Education from the Faculty of Alagoas, Brazil,
        followed by a Master&apos;s degree at the same institution where I am
        now completing my doctoral studies.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4 leading-7">
        Throughout my Master&apos;s and PhD, my research has focused on
        statistical modeling and data analysis from wearable devices, especially
        accelerometers. My main work involves the development of methods for
        estimating mechanical loading variables using raw accelerometer data.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4 leading-7">
        I&apos;m also a husband and a proud father to a little boy. Beyond my
        professional life, I have a deep love for running, which has taken me
        across the finish lines of two marathons and three half-marathons.
